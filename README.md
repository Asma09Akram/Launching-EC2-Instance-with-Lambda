## AWS LAMBDA

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service. We run code without provisioning or managing servers, creating workload-aware cluster scaling logic, maintaining event integrations, or managing runtimes. 
Run code for virtually any type of application or backend service. Just upload your code as a ZIP file or container image, 
and Lambda automatically allocates compute execution power and runs your code based on the incoming request or event, for any scale of traffic.
Write Lambda functions in your favorite language (Node.js, Python, Go, Java, and more) and use both serverless and container tools, such as AWS SAM or Docker CLI, to build, test, and deploy your functions.
